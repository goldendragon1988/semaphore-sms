# Semaphore::Sms

This is a ruby api wrapper for Semaphore, https://semaphore.co/

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'semaphore-sms'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install semaphore-sms

## Usage

Run:
```ruby
rails g semaphore:sms:install
```

Note:

  This will generate a file in `config/initializers` called `semaphore-sms.rb`. Configure semaphore api here.

```
Semaphore::Sms.setup do |config|
  # config.api_key = "YOUR API KEY HERE"
  # NOTE: add if you want to use a single sender name by default.
  # config.sender_name = "SEMAPHORE"
end
```
Below we demonstrate the most basic usage of the library:

```ruby
require "semaphore-sms"

# You should already configure you api key under `initializers/semaphore-sms.rb`
    client = Semaphore::Sms.client

# Sending a single message.

    client.send("Hello World", "09175488888")

  # response

    [
      {
        "message_id" => 55871500,
        "user_id" => 4788,
        "user" => "jag.arnold.go@gmail.com",

# Sending a message using a sender name.

    client.send("Hello World", ["09175488888", "09175488888"], "SAITAMA")

    NOTE: By default you can configure your sender name in `config/initializers/semaphore-sms` or
          pass a third agument to overwrite existing sender name in `initializers/semaphore-sms.rb`.
          If no sendername is attached it will default to `Semaphore`.
